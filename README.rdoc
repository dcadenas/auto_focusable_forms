== DESCRIPTION:

Install this plugin to automatically give focus to your forms.

== SYNOPSIS:

If you have this two forms in your view...

  form_for @user do |f|
    f.text_field :name
    f.text_field :surname
    fields_for @post do |g|
      g.text_field :title
      g.text_area :content
    end
  end

  form_for @post do |f|
    f.text_field :title
  end

...you'll see that the name field will have focus. Disabled and readonly fields are ignored.

If you want to disable this behaviour just add :autofocus => false and the form will have the original Rails behaviour. So if for example you want to give focus to the second form in your view you'd just disable autofocus in the first form:

  form_for @user, :autofocus => false do |f|
    f.text_field :name
    f.text_field :surname
  end
  
  form_for @post do |f|
    f.text_field :title
    f.text_field :content
  end

And now the focus will be in the title field.
