AutoFocusableForms
==================

Install this plugin to give focus to the first input of your forms automatically.

Example
=======

form_for @user do |f|
  f.text_field :name <== this field will have a $('user_name').focus() script next to it
  f.text_field :surname
end

If you want to disable this behaviour just add :autofocus => false
Example:

form_for @user do |f|
  f.text_field :name <== this input will have a $('user_name').focus() script next to it
  fields_for @post, :autofocus => false do |g|
    g.text_field :title <== now this input will not have focus and no other input will have
    g.text_field :content
  end
  f.text_field :surname
end
