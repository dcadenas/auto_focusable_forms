Auto Focusable Forms
====================

Install this plugin to automatically give focus to the first input of your forms.

Example
=======

After you install the plugin all your forms will have focus on the first element by default

form_for @user do |f|
  f.text_field :name <== this field will have a $('user_name').focus() script next to it
  f.text_field :surname
  fields_for @post do |g|
    g.text_field :title
    g.text_area :content
  end
end

If you want to disable this behaviour just add :autofocus => false and the form will have the original Rails behaviour

Example:

form_for @user, :autofocus => false do |f|
  f.text_field :name
  f.text_field :surname
end

See the specs for more examples
