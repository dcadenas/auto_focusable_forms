Auto Focusable Forms
====================

Install this plugin to automatically give focus to your forms.

Example
=======

If you have this two forms in your view...

form_for @user do |f|
  f.text_field :name
  f.text_field :surname
  fields_for @post do |g|
    g.text_field :title
    g.text_area :content
  end
end

form_for @post do |f|
  f.text_field :title
end

...you'll see that the name field will have focus.

If you want to disable this behaviour just add :autofocus => false and the form will have the original Rails behaviour. So if for example you want to give focus to the second form in your view you'd just disable autofocus in the first form:

form_for @user, :autofocus => false do |f|
  f.text_field :name
  f.text_field :surname
end

form_for @post do |f|
  f.text_field :title
  f.text_field :content
end

And now the focus will be in the title field.

See the specs for more examples
